-Add AGC circuit for receiver.
-Add AGC cricuit for transmitter.
-Move the audio potentiometer to the next amplifier stage (Q20).
-AGC to read the audio voltage?
-Redesign first audio stage Q16.
-Not sure about the BFO mixer design - R14-R15 resistors.
-Test if diodes in emitter of JFET IF amps will stabilise gain vs. VCC.

-The input impedance into cascode bjt+jfet stages are not stable with voltage
 and are not 100% defined by R into the Gate - need to measure the complex
 impedance for these stages.
-The IF filter need buffers at input and output.
-Correctly adapt the IF filter into the circuit by measuring i/o impedances.
-Fix some footprints on the PCB.
-Fix CV footprints on the PCB.
-C51 really needed? seem to cut some high frequencies but when the volume is
 set to maximum it tend to amplify high freq too much.
-C35 / 470u must be replaced with 1000u low esr.
-Connect Q7 and Q35 directly to +12V?
-Replace isolation capacitors found between IF stages (10p, 5p6, etc) to
 100n + Xohms, because when changing IF from 10MHz to 10.7MHz, the gain
 increases. Adding resistors + 100n will keep the gain stable.
-Resonating tank from cascode bjt+jfet stages are composed by 10-30pF+9.7-11uH.
 Also, the Q is too big?
-IF amplifier stages tends to autooscillate when the gain is too big.
